# Headset Battery Info

Application for monitoring your VR headset's battery level and state via external overlays (such as [OVR Toolkit](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1068820/OVR_Toolkit/) or [XSOverlay](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1173510/XSOverlay/)).\
Originally planned to work with [APK on headset](https://github.com/DangerKiddy/Headset-Battery-Info-Sender), but due Android limitations can't be implemented right now so currently it works with Pico's Streaming Assistant.\

Currently looking for help to fix APK's issue. If you're good with Android Java then message me on Discord (@dangerkiddy) or create an Issue/Pull Request in [APK's repo](https://github.com/DangerKiddy/Headset-Battery-Info-Sender)
